    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a hub-and-spoke design. The main view is a "hub" of clickable category cards for high-level thematic Browse (e.g., "In Christ," "By His Blood"). Clicking a card smoothly scrolls the user to a dedicated "spoke" or section on the same page. Within each section, scriptures are presented in a collapsible accordion format, encouraging focused reading by hiding details until requested. This layered approach prevents overwhelming the user and promotes exploration. A key feature is a dynamic search bar that filters all scriptures across all categories in real-time, allowing for powerful thematic discovery beyond the predefined categories. This structure was chosen over a simple list to transform passive reading into an active, user-driven exploration of the content. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The source report consists entirely of hierarchical text (Categories -> Scriptures -> Translations/Explanations). The goal is to organize this text and make it explorable. The chosen presentation method is a system of interactive cards and accordions built with HTML/CSS/Tailwind and powered by Vanilla JS. Goal: Organize -> Method: Thematic sections with accordion lists. Interaction: Click to expand/collapse scripture details. This keeps the UI clean and focused. Goal: Explore/Find -> Method: A dynamic search input field. Interaction: Typing filters and highlights relevant scriptures across all sections. This allows users to discover connections and themes not immediately apparent in the original structure. No charts are needed as there is no quantitative data. The emojis from the source (✅, 💖, 📝) are retained to preserve the tone. CONFIRMING NO SVG/Mermaid. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
